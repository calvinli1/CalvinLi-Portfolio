# Calvin Li - Portfolio

**Software Developer | Hardware Engineer | Embedded Systems Specialist**

Welcome to my personal portfolio. I am a Computer Engineering student at **Boston University**, passionate about bridging the gap between physical hardware and embedded software. From circuit design and custom CAD enclosures to writing the C++ firmware that brings them to life, I love building things from the ground up.
